    <h3 class="heading-medium underline">What you should report on</h3>
    @shared._coverageInformation()

    <h3 class="heading-medium underline">What you need to report</h3>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Start and end date of reporting period</h4>
    These are shown above, under 'Your reporting periods and deadlines'.


    <h4 class="heading-small">Average time to pay in days</h4>
    Of all the payments you made in the reporting period, the average time it took to pay.
    Only include payments that you have made under qualifying contracts during the reporting period.


    <h4 class="heading-small">Percentage of invoices paid</h4>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>within 30 days</li>
        <li>in 31 to 60 days</li>
        <li>in 61 days or more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only include payments that you have made under qualifying contracts during the reporting period.</p>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Percentage of invoices due which werenâ€™t paid within the agreed period</h4>
    This relates to the number of invoices, not their value. Count all invoices where the contractually agreed
    date for payment was within the reporting period. This includes unpaid and disputed invoices.

    <h4 class="heading-small">Standard payment period</h4>
    This is your standard contractual payment period in days.

    <h4 class="heading-small">Standard payment terms</h4>
    This must include a description of your standard payment terms.
    If you have different terms for different types of supplier or product, you should explain them.
    If you do not use standard payment terms you must describe your most frequently used payment terms.
    As well as describing you standard or most frequently used payment terms, can can also include a link to your
    payment terms on your own website if you want to.

    <h4 class="heading-small">Your maximum contractual payment period</h4>
    This is the longest payment period agreed with a supplier in a contract signed during the reporting period.
    You must enter the number of days. There is also an optional box if you would like to add more information.

    <h4 class="heading-small">Changes to your standard terms</h4>
    If you changed your standard terms during the reporting period, include details of exactly what has changed:
    be sure to include the 'before' and 'after' situation. You must also state whether you consulted or notified
    suppliers about any changes, and how you did this.

    <h4 class="heading-small">Your dispute resolution process</h4>
    <p>Describe how you respond to complaints from suppliers, and how you resolve payment disputes.</p>
    <p>This helps suppliers know who to contact and to understand the process they need to follow to resolve a dispute or concern.</p>
    <p>This may be a detailed process, or simply an explanation that a complaint or concern will be considered by a particular department or job title, the usual timescale and next steps.</p>
    <p>If your business has a dispute resolution process already published on their website, they could include a hyperlink here alongside a brief explanation of the process.</p>

    <h4 class="heading-small">Does your business offer e-invoicing for qualifying contracts?</h4>
    This is where suppliers can electronically submit and track invoices. It's not just allowing suppliers to email you an invoice.
    This is a 'Yes' or 'No' question.


    <h4 class="heading-small">Does your business offer supply chain finance options?</h4>
    This is where you have an arrangement where a supplier who has submitted an invoice can be paid by a third-party
    finance provider earlier than the agreed payment date. Your business would then pay the finance provider the invoiced sum by the payment date.
    This is a 'Yes' or 'No' question.
    <br>
    You can give more details about this in your information about your standard payment terms, but you don't have to.

    <h4 class="heading-small">
        Under its payment practices and policies, can your business deduct sums from payments under qualifying contracts as a charge for remaining on a supplier list?</h4>
    This is about what is possible under your policies.
    This is a 'Yes' or 'No' question.

    <h4 class="heading-small">In this reporting period, has your business deducted sums from payments as a charge for remaining on a supplier list?</h4>
    This question is about whether your business did this in the reporting period.
    You must answer this even if you answered 'no' to the above question.

    <h4 class="heading-small">Has your business signed up to a code of conduct or standards on payment practices?</h4>
    For example, the Prompt Payment Code
    This is a 'Yes' or 'No' question.
    If the answer is 'Yes', you will be asked the name of the code of conduct or standards that you are part of.
