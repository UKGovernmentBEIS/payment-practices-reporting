        You need a Companies House account and authentication code before you can publish your payment report. To request an authentication code from Companies House:</p>
    <ul class="list list-number">
        <li>Sign in to your Companies House online account. If you don't have one, you can register online.</li>
        <li>When asked to enter your authentication code, click <span class="bold-small">
            Request an authentication code</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The code will be sent to your companyâ€™s registered office by post, so allow plenty of time for delivery. You can then use this code to log on and publish your report.
