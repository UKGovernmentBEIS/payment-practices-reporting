    The information you provide must relate to 'qualifying contracts'. </p>
<p> A qualifying contract is a contract which satisfies all of the following:
</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>It is between 2 (or more) businesses</li>

    <li>It has a significant connection with the UK (as explained below)</li>

    <li>It is for goods, services or intangible property, including intellectual property</li>

    <li>It is not for <a rel="external" target="_blank" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/26/section/2/enacted">financial services</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="heading-small">Significant Connection to the UK</h3>

<p>
  Where UK law (the law of England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) applies to a contract without the parties choosing the governing law, then the contract is sufficiently connected to the UK and must be reported on.
</p>
<p>
  Other examples of contracts that have a ‘significant connection’ to the UK and must be reported on are:
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>contracts that will be performed in the UK (goods will be delivered or services carried out in the UK)</li>
    <li>contracts where the supplier is established in the UK </li>
    <li>contracts where one or both parties carries on a relevant part of their business in the UK</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  If a contract doesn’t contain a clause stating which country’s law applies to it, the applicable law will be determined by legal rules.
</p>

<p>
  If the parties choose UK law (the law of England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland) to apply to a contract, but it has no significant connection with the UK then it should not be covered in the business’s reporting information.
</p>

<p>
  If the parties choose non-UK law to apply to the contract, but it would have been governed by UK law if the parties hadn’t made that choice, it must still be included in the business’s published information.
