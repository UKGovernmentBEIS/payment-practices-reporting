        Youâ€™ll normally have to report twice per financial year, with the first report covering 6 months, and the second
        covering the remainder of the financial year.

            <p>
                If your financial year is shorter or longer than twelve months by a few days or weeks, your second
                reporting period in a financial year may be slightly shorter or longer than six months as it will cover
                the remainder of the financial year. There are different rules if your financial year is 9 months or
                less or more than 15 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have shortened your accounting period to 9 months or less, you will only need to report once for that
                financial year. If you have extended your accounting reference period to more than 15 months, you will need to report 3
                times, with the second report covering months 7 to 12 of your financial year, and the third report covering
                the remainder of the financial year.
